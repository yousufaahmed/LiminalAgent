This starter project gives you everything you need to create intelligent financial agents powered by Claude AI and Liminal's banking platform. No complex setup, no mock data — just real banking tools and a beautiful chat interface.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

Create conversational AI agents that can:

- 💰 **Check balances** across wallet and savings accounts
- 📊 **Analyze spending** patterns and provide insights
- 💸 **Send money** to other users (with confirmation)
- 🏦 **Manage savings** deposits and withdrawals
- 📈 **Track transactions** and financial history
- 🎯 **Set weekly spending goals** with real-time progress tracking
- 🤖 **Custom analytics** - the sky's the limit!

All through natural conversation in a beautiful chat interface.

---

## 🚀 5-Minute Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+** installed ([Download](https://go.dev/dl/))
- **Node.js 18+** installed ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Anthropic API key** ([Get one](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Step 1: Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/becomeliminal/nim-go-sdk.git
cd nim-go-sdk/examples/hackathon-starter

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Add Your Anthropic API Key

Edit `.env` and add your Anthropic key:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

That's it! Liminal authentication is automatic via the login flow in the chat interface.

### Step 3: Start the Backend

```bash
# Install Go dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run the server
go run main.go
```

You should see:
```
✅ Liminal API configured
✅ Added 9 Liminal banking tools
✅ Added custom spending analyzer and weekly goal tools
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚀 Hackathon Starter Server Running
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📡 WebSocket endpoint: ws://localhost:8080/ws
💚 Health check: http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Step 4: Start the Frontend

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Your browser will open to `http://localhost:5173` with a beautiful chat interface!

### Step 5: Login and Try It Out!

Click the chat bubble, then:

1. **Login** with your email (you'll get an OTP code)
2. Enter the code to authenticate
3. Start chatting! Try:
   - "What's my balance?"
   - "Show me my recent transactions"
   - "Analyze my spending over the last 30 days"

Authentication is automatic from this point forward - JWT tokens are managed under the hood.

---

## 🔑 Getting Your Anthropic API Key

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Create a new key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)
6. Add it to your `.env` file

### Liminal Authentication

**No API key needed!** Liminal authentication works automatically:

1. When you first use the chat, you'll see a login screen
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for a one-time code (OTP)
4. Enter the code to authenticate
5. That's it! Your session is authenticated via JWT tokens managed automatically

The SDK handles all JWT token management, extraction, and refreshing under the hood. You never need to manually manage Liminal credentials.

## 🛠️ Built-in Liminal Banking Tools

Your AI agent has access to **9 core banking tools** plus **custom analytics tools** out of the box:

### Read Operations (No Confirmation)

| Tool | Description | Example Query |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `get_balance` | Check wallet balance | "What's my balance?" |
| `get_savings_balance` | Check savings positions & APY | "How much is in my savings?" |
| `get_vault_rates` | Get current savings rates | "What's the APY for savings?" |
| `get_transactions` | View transaction history | "Show my recent transactions" |
| `get_profile` | Get user profile info | "What's my display tag?" |
| `search_users` | Find users by display tag | "Search for @alice" |
| `analyze_spending` | Analyze spending patterns & trends | "Analyze my spending" |
| `get_weekly_spending_progress` | Check weekly goal progress | "How am I doing this week?" |

### Write Operations (Require Confirmation)

| Tool | Description | Example Query |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `send_money` | Send money to another user | "Send $50 to @alice" |
| `deposit_savings` | Deposit funds into savings | "Put $100 in savings" |
| `withdraw_savings` | Withdraw funds from savings | "Withdraw $50 from savings" |
| `spend_weekly_goal` | Set weekly spending goal | "Set my weekly spend to 5 LIL" |

All write operations require explicit user confirmation through the chat interface. The UI will show a countdown timer and summary before executing.

## 🎨 Adding Custom Tools

This is where your hackathon magic happens! The starter includes:
- **Spending Analyzer** - Analyzes transaction patterns, velocity, and trends
- **Weekly Spending Goal** - Sets goals with confirmation and tracks progress in real-time with a visual progress bar widget

Here's how to add your own tools:

### 1. Define Your Tool

In `main.go`, add a new tool after the existing ones:

```go
// Add your custom tool
srv.AddTool(createBudgetTrackerTool(liminalExecutor))
```

### 2. Implement the Tool

```go
func createBudgetTrackerTool(liminalExecutor core.ToolExecutor) core.Tool {
    return tools.New("track_budget").
        Description("Track spending against a monthly budget and alert when approaching limits").
        Schema(tools.ObjectSchema(map[string]interface{}{
            "budget_amount": tools.StringProperty("Monthly budget amount (e.g., '1000')"),
            "category": tools.StringProperty("Budget category (e.g., 'dining', 'entertainment')"),
        }, "budget_amount")).
        HandlerFunc(func(ctx context.Context, input json.RawMessage) (interface{}, error) {
            // 1. Parse input
            var params struct {
                BudgetAmount string `json:"budget_amount"`
                Category     string `json:"category"`
            }
            json.Unmarshal(input, &params)

            // 2. Fetch transaction data
            txRequest := map[string]interface{}{"limit": 100}
            txRequestJSON, _ := json.Marshal(txRequest)
            txResponse, _ := liminalExecutor.Execute(ctx, "get_transactions", txRequestJSON)

            // 3. Analyze and compare to budget
            spent := calculateCategorySpending(txResponse, params.Category)
            budgetAmount, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(params.Budget Amount, 64)
            percentUsed := (spent / budgetAmount) * 100

            // 4. Return insights
            return map[string]interface{}{
                "budget":        params.BudgetAmount,
                "spent":         fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", spent),
                "remaining":     fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", budgetAmount - spent),
                "percent_used":  fmt.Sprintf("%.1f%%", percentUsed),
                "status":        getBudgetStatus(percentUsed),
                "alert":         percentUsed > 80,
            }, nil
        }).
        Build()
}
```

### 3. Update the System Prompt

Add your new tool to the system prompt in `main.go`:

```go
const hackathonSystemPrompt = `You are Nim...

CUSTOM ANALYTICAL TOOLS:
- Analyze spending patterns (analyze_spending)
- Set weekly spending goal (spend_weekly_goal) - requires confirmation
- Check weekly spending progress (get_weekly_spending_progress)
- Track budget goals (track_budget)  // <-- Add this
...`
```

### 4. Test It

Restart your backend and try:
- "Track my dining budget of $500"
- "Am I on track with my budget?"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

**Error:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is required`
- **Fix:** Make sure you created `.env` and added your Anthropic API key

**Error:** `address already in use :8080`
- **Fix:** Another process is using port 8080. Change the PORT in `.env` or kill the other process

### Frontend won't connect

**Error:** `WebSocket connection failed`
- **Fix:** Make sure the backend is running on port 8080
- **Fix:** Check that the backend shows "WebSocket endpoint: ws://localhost:8080/ws"

**Error:** `Module not found: '@becomeliminal/nim-chat'`
- **Fix:** Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
- **Fix:** Make sure `nim-chat` is built: `cd ../../../nim-chat && npm install && npm run build`

### Authentication not working

**Can't login to Liminal:**
1. Make sure you entered a valid email address
2. Check your email (including spam folder) for the OTP code
3. The code expires after a few minutes - request a new one if needed
4. Contact a hackathon organizer if you're not receiving codes

**Anthropic API Key Invalid:**
1. Check the key starts with `sk-ant-`
2. Verify it's copied correctly with no extra spaces
3. Check your Anthropic console for API key status
4. Make sure your account has credits
